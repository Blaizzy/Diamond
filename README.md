# Diamond

A dataset comprised of 54 K Diamonds.

# Goal

This is a supervised problem we have some diamond features x and we want to predict the price y.

The price is a continuous value so this is a regression problem. We will need to use MSE(Mean Squared Error) loss, 1 output unit and no activation on the last layer.
